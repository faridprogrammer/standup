One of the most dangerous things that people do to themselves is to sit down behind a desk and work with computer long. Sitting down for long periods causes back pain, neck pain and problems in knees and in some cases disc herniation, increases risk of diabetes, heart disease, etc. If you’re sitting for long periods it’s really important you take regular breaks by getting up on your feet. It is recommended to stand up for at least 30 seconds each 20 minutes.

Stand Up application reminds you to stand up.

What Stand Up application does is to show a black screen every 20 minutes (configurable duration) and asks you to stand up.
